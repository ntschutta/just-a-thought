I'm [very excited to announce](https://twitter.com/ntschutta/status/997184365363843073) my latest book project, Thinking Architecturally, is [now available](https://content.pivotal.io/ebooks/thinking-architecturally)! My thoughts on being an architect, dealing w/ change, etc. If youâ€™ve attended one of my talks in the last few years, you will recognize some of the material. The reception has been beyond my expectations and I am delighted by the responses I've received from people that have read the book. If you are interested in perusing the material, it is a [free download](https://content.pivotal.io/ebooks/thinking-architecturally) from the [Pivotal Resource center](https://content.pivotal.io/resources). Enjoy and please reach out with feedback! Thanks!
