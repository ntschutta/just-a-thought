# Abstract and optional shortened version.

But many don't realize that although the job title suggests a work day focused on technical decision making, the reality is quite different. Over two days, Nathaniel Schutta details the skills you need for success in the real world, where communication trumps coding, as he walks you through what it means to be a successful architect."
