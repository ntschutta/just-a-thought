abstract = "You’re giving a talk on a subject you know inside and out and your audience is staring at their cell phones. You’re boring your audience. Maybe you could use some help. In this fast paced humorous video, presentation pros Neal Ford and Nathaniel Schutta provide that help. They’ve spent thousands of hours giving talks at seminars around the world and even more hours listening to bad ones. They’ve used this experience to de-construct “The Presentation” into a set of patterns and anti-patterns. What are patterns and anti-patterns? They’re simply names (often funny ones) for the building blocks of good presentation practices (patterns) and the stumbling blocks of bad ones (anti-patterns). Ford and Schutta offer concrete instruction in how to plan your presentation, handle a wide variety of presentation types, manage your audiences, and deal with constraints and surprises"
