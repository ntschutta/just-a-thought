### Full Abstract
By now, just about every organization has at least a phalanx or two in the “Cloud” and it is, understandably changing the way we architect our systems. But there is a lot of confusion around cloud native, 12 factors, modular monoliths, serverless...how does a busy technologist make sense of it all? Despite what you may have read on the Internet, there still are no silver bullets - just a set of tools that we need to apply at the right time in the right place. In this talk we will survey the various options today’s application teams have at their disposal looking at the consequences of various approaches. We will clear up the buzzword bingo giving you a solid foundation as you take your cloud native journey.
