### Full Abstract
Software developers are seemingly on a perpetual path to discover the one true technology to unite them all. And yet there are no golden hammers, there is no one size fits all solutions. Instead we have to carefully weigh the pros and cons of our options and in some instances take the least worst approach. Rather than continue down this trail of disappointment, we need to embrace the and not the or. There can only be one does not in fact apply to software.
