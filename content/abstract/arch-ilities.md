### Full Abstract
As a developer, your focus was squarely on the “functional requirements” aka the business capabilities your application must meet. But once you step in the architect role, you discover a world inhabited by “the ilities” otherwise known as the non functional or quality attributes of a software system. But how do we know which ilities matter and which ones don't? And much as we may want to turn every knob up to 11, many ilities are inversely related - maximize one and you by definition minimize another.

In this talk we will look at various architectural problems giving participants opportunities to try and balance non functional requirements. We'll discuss the consequences of various approaches as well as how we can best document the inevitable decisions we arrive at.
